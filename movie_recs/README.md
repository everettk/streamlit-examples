# movie_recs
In this project, we build a movie recommendation system together. To follow
along, please start (here)[www.link-goes-here].

To start (only the very first time):
```conda env create -f movie_recs_env.yml```

From then on:
```conda activate movie_recs_env```

If you make changes to movie_recs_env.yml (with movie_recs_env activated):
```conda env update movie_recs_env -f=movie_recs_env.yml```

To start:
```cd src```
```python week0_intro.py```
