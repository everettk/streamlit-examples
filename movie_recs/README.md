# Movie Recommendation with Streamlit

In this guide, we walk you through the lifecycle of an Insight ML project. You
can think of this guide as a "making-of" Amber Robertâ€™s
[Project Orient](https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/Project-Orient).
Together, we will build a movie recommendation system using the
[MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset.

The project is broken into four parts, which correspond roughly to the weeks of
an Insight session.

1. **Exploring Data with Streamlit** - to better understand what we're working
with, we slice and dice and explore the MovieLens dataset.
2. **Recommendation System v0** - we build a naive recommendation system
end-to-end.
3. **Iterating on our recommendation system** - we experiment with two different
matrix factorization techniques to generate better recommendations.
4. **Running at scale** - we take our algorithm and scale it up! This time we
run it over a dataset that is 200X larger than in week 3!

## To Get Started
1. In your terminal, run the following command from the `streamlit-examples` directory:

```atom . src/week1_explore.py```

2. In Atom, press `ctrl+alt+r` to run the report.
