Welcome to the Streamlit Guide for Insight fellows! Hopefully you reached this
point from [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCsFFjrptPxMfr-HUU8QD154rGooemvHVZ95Q3iNZLc/edit?usp=sharing).
If not, make sure you read those instructions first.

In this guide, we walk you through the lifecycle of an Insight ML project. You
can think of this guide as a "making-of" Amber Robertâ€™s [Project Orient](https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/Project-Orient). Together, we will build a
movie recommendation system using the [MovieLens]
(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. Awesome. Let's get started!

This project is broken into four parts, which correspond roughly to the weeks of
an Insight session.

1. **Exploring Data with Streamlit** - to better understand what we're working
with, we slice and dice and explore the MovieLens dataset.
2. **Recommendation System v0** - we build a naive recommendation system
end-to-end.
3. **Iterating on our recommendation system** - we experiment with two different
matrix factorization techniques to generate better recommendations.
4. **Running at scale** - we take our algorithm and run it on a dataset that is
200X larger. We run our report remotely on an AWS instance with a GPU.
