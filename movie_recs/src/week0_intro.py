Welcome to the Streamlit Guide for Insight fellows! In this guide, we walk you
through the lifecycle of an Insight ML project. You can think of this guide as
a "making-of" Amber Robertâ€™s [Project Orient]
(https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/Project-Orient). Together, we will build a
movie recommendation system using the [MovieLens]
(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. Awesome, let's get started!

This project is broken into four parts, which correspond roughly to the weeks of
an Insight session.

1. **Exploring Data with Streamlit** - to better understand what we're working
with, we slice and dice and explore the MovieLens dataset.
2. **Recommendation System v0** - we build a naive recommendation system
end-to-end.
3. **Iterating on our recommendation system** - we experiment with two different
matrix factorization techniques to generate better recommendations.
4. **Running at scale** - we take our algorithm and run it on a dataset that is
200X larger. We run our report remotely on an AWS instance with a GPU.

st.header('Before We Start')
st.write("""
Before we start on this project, let's make sure a few things are set up first.

1. Do you have Streamlit installed? If not, instructions are [here](___)
2. Do you have Atom installed? If not, download it from [here](https://atom.io/)
3. Do you have the Atom+Streamlit integration yet? If not, check out the
**Trying it out** section [here](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-atom/pull/1).

Though you can use Streamlit with any IDE or text editor, we **strongly**
recommend Atom. The remainder of the guide assumes you are using Atom with the
Streamlit package installed.

1. Clone the Streamlit examples repo:
```git clone https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit_examples```
2. Open week1_explore.py in Atom.
3. Open the Streamlit side pane. Run your code.
Your screen should now look something like this:
